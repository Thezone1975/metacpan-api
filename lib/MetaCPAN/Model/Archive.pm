=head1 NAME

MetaCPAN::Model::Archive - Inspect and extract archive files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use MetaCPAN::Model::Archive;

    my $archive = MetaCPAN::Model::Archive->new( file => $some_file );
    my $files = $archive->files;
    my $extraction_dir = $archive->extract;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class manages getting information about and extraction of archive
files (tarballs, zipfiles, etc...) and their extraction directories.

The object is read-only and will only extract once.  If you alter the
extraction directory and want a fresh one, make a new object.

The Archive will clean up its extraction directory upon destruction.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head3 archive

I<Required>

The file to be extracted.  It will be returned as a Path::Class
object.

=head1 METHODS

=head3 files

    my $files = $archive->files;

A list of the files in the archive as an array ref.

        my $self = shift;
        return [ $self->_extractor->files ];
    },
);

=head3 extract

    my $extract_dir = $archive->extract;

Extract the archive into a temp directory.  The directory will be a
L<Path::Class::Dir>.

Only the first call to extract will perform the extraction.  After
that it will just return the extraction directory.  If you want to
re-extract the archive, create a new object.

The extraction directory will be cleaned up when the object is destroyed.

sub extract {
    my $self = shift;

    return $self->extract_dir if $self->_has_extracted;

    $self->_extractor->extract( $self->extract_dir );
    $self->_set_has_extracted(1);

    return $self->extract_dir;
}
